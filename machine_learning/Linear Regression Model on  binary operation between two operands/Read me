1. Linear Regression project.
2. The Model is trained on 100 training cases.
3. Each training case consist of x1,x2,x1*x2,x1*x1,x2*x2,x1+x2, where x1 and x2 are two integer numbers randomly generated.
4. Matrix X (feature matrix) consists of columns of x1,x2,x1*x2,x1*x1,x2*x2.
5. Matrix y (label vector) consists of column of x1+x2.
6. The trainig data is generated using c++ programme.
7. The optimal theta(paratmeter) vector is calculated using inbuilt octave method fminunc().
8. The cost and gradient without regularization is calculated using function costFunction() which is written in file costFunction.m . 
9. Test data is generated using c++ programme.
On running this this model the output should be sum of two numbers.
Using this model we can generate the output of operation between two numbers without actually knowing the operation in training set.
